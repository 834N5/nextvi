NEATVI
======

Neatvi is a vi/ex editor.  It can edit bidirectional UTF-8 text.

FORK CHANGES
------------
1. Added unindent keybind: ^q 
2. Added quickexit to insert mode keybind: kj   
It's important to understand that this has a caveat, if
input comes too fast, for example a paste from terminal and
the sequence has "kj" in it, insert mode will be cancelled mid way
and paste will be wrong. Luckly this almost never happens because
such letter combination is extremely rare.
3. Added linenumbers, keybind: # 
4. Added invisible character view, keybind: V   
5. Added regex for changing spaces to tabs, keybind: ^i   
6. Added regex for removing /r in dos files, keybind: ^ii 
7. Changed behavior of ^a to change search direction when no more match 
8. Added fssearch, searches what is under the cursor 
in every file in the opened directory keybind: ^]   
Beware that it will brute force open files into buffers and
perform the search. I usually save really often so this isn't 
a problem, but being careless might reload file with unsaved changes.
By default it only checks for .c and .h files. 
for code navigation between files, jump to definitions / etc.
9. fssearch but going in reverse keybind: ^p
10. Added key to change the mark origin which ^p will return to keybind: ^t
11. Added ex command "ea" which opens file case insensitive and ignores the path,
setting an extra number parameter after filename will skip that many matches with
similar path. So for example file might be named "file123.c" but you can open it
just by "ea fi" if this is a uniquely matched filename
12. Added ex command "dir" to set the directory for fssearch or "ea" ex command
13. Added numbered buffers to vi, max 10 and ex "b" command to show buffers
and "b%d" to switch (where %d is the buffer number).
14. Added key to show buffers and switch buffer 
(to switch press corresponding 0-9 number) keybind: ^s 
15. Added key to exit vi keybind: qq 
16. Added key to goto line 0 keybind: gg 
17. Added key to delete everything inside (cursor outside) "" keybind: di" 
18. Added key to delete everything inside () keybind: di) 
19. Added key to delete everything inside (cursor outside) () keybind: di( 
20. Added key to change . to -> on cursor line keybind: vh
21. Added key to change -> to . on cursor line keybind: vg
22. Added ex command "z" it does the same thing "!" does but the shell is
launched in interactive mode, so stuff like aliases work. But it will cause
vi to suspend.
23. Changed the colors for C language in conf.h to be sane
24. Added extra highlight keywords for C
25. Added key that splits the line (opposite of J) keybind: K
26. Added key that line wraps text to 80 line limit keybind: gq 
27. Added key that deletes relative line 
without moving the cursor (down) keybind: arg+I (up) keybind arg+R
28. Added ability to view the numbers for arguments that keys e,w,E,W,b,B
may take. keybind: ^v Pressing again will change the key mode, specifying
any arguments will exit the mode. This is a major step up to how navigation
works in vi, it makes it so much easier to use because now you can see where 
you are going. If not anything else I suggest you to try out this distro
just to see it in action.
29. Added ability to change highlight dynamically.
30. New ex option "hww" which highlights every instance of word under the
cursor when enabled. Useful for when studying source code.
31. Added autocomplete in insert mode. Press ^g to index the current opened
file. Then you can press ^n to cycle though the options, results are based on
the contents of the file and the closest match to what you typed.
32. Added ex command "inc" which sets the filename filter for the feature
mentioned in (8.)
33. Added hund file manager (hund.c) keybind: \
34. Added key to save current file keybind: ^k
35. The new special character "/" for ft in conf.h now signifies that 
the regex will be applied on any file. The reason "/" was 
chosen because it's forbidden filename character on unix. 
36. Added a window size signal handler for vi to
redraw the screen automatically
37. Added history buffer for ex commands when in vi prompt.
keybind: ^b will open the buffer with all previous commands
move the cursor to wanted command and exit buffer with qq  
will copy the command into prompt. You can also use this
when half way through some command and need to access normal
mode to edit the command more efficiently.

CONFIGURATION
-------------

Edit conf.h to adjust syntax highlighting rules and text direction
patterns.  To define a new keymap, create a new array in kmap.h, like
kmap_fa, and add it to kmaps array in the same header (the first entry
of the new array specifies its name).  The current keymap may be
changed with :cm ex command.  When in input mode, ^e activates the
English kaymap and ^f switches to the alternate keymap (the last
keymap specified with :cm).

COMMANDS
--------

Commands not available in ex(1):

:cm[ap][!] [kmap]
  Without kmap, prints the current keymap name.
  When kmap is specified, sets the alternate keymap to
  kmap and, unless ! is given, switches to this keymap.
:ft [filetype]
  Without filetype, prints the current file type.
  When filetype is specified, sets the file type of the
  current ex buffer.

New key mappings:
^a in normal mode: searches for the word under the cursor.
^p in insert mode: inserts the contents of the default yank buffer.
zL, zl, zr, and zR in normal mode: change the value of td option.
^e and ^f in insert mode: switch to the English and alternate keymap.
ze and zf in normal mode: switch to the English and alternate keymap.
gu, gU, and g~ in normal mode: switch character case.
^l in normal mode: updates terminal dimensions (after resizing it).

OPTIONS
-------

To improve neatvi's performance, shaping, character reordering, and
syntax highlighting can be disabled by defining the EXINIT environment
variable as "set noshape | set noorder | set nohl | set td=+2".

Options supported in neatvi:

td, textdirection
  Current direction context.  The following values are meaningful:
  * +2: always left-to-right.
  * +1: follow conf.h's dircontexts[]; left-to-right for others.
  * -1: follow conf.h's dircontexts[]; right-to-left for others.
  * -2: always right-to-left.
shape
  If set (default), performs Arabic/Farsi letter shaping.
order
  If set, reorder characters based on the rules defined
  in conf.h.
hl, highlight
  If set (default), text will be highlighted based on syntax
  highlighting rules in conf.h.
hll, highlightline
  If set, highlight current line.
ai, autoindent
  As in vi(1).
aw, autowrite
  As in vi(1).
ic, ignorecase
  As in vi(1).

MARKS AND BUFFERS
-----------------

Special marks:
* the position of the previous change
[ the first line of the previous change
] the last line of the previous change

Special yank buffers:
/ the previous search keyword
: the previous ex command
